                    and to target specific skills/reinforce concepts.

                        <p>

                            Inclusion is about:

                            <br><br>

                            <ul>

                                <li>Respect for all people</li>
                                <li>Appreciating differences</li>
                                <li>Recognizing our common humanity</li>


                            </ul>

                            <br><br>

                            Each individual possesses the potential for greatness, though that <br> greatness may manifest itself through 
                            different <br> forms, take different paths, or require different levels of support in order to attain it. <br>
                            We must work to cultivate this greatness in every one of our scholars, <br> even those (perhaps especially those), 
                            who do not believe in <br> themselves, and who have no one else to believe in them either. <br> There is no way to 
                            push each scholar along a different path, with <br> different levels of support, to reach a different goal, 
                            without <br> differentiating and tailoring our approach just a little bit, for each child.

                        It is not enough for our scholars to see their own uniqueness, potential and to work toward their
                        own future.To truly be successful, they must also get along with and work effectively with others 
                        in their school, and in the broader society (<b>others who may be very different</b>) from themselves 
                        or who may have very different needs. Among many important lessons that we teach our scholars, 
                        we should be sure to include these:  <br><br>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Fairness doesn't mean everyone gets the same--it means everyone <br> gets what they need.</li> <br>
                            <li>Each of us contributes to our community in a different but equally <br> meaningful way.</li> <br>
                            <li>Always treat others dignity and humility.</li>
                        </ul>
